**Fantasy Points** - 0.5 PPR Fantasy points scored via receiving (does not include rushing stats)

**Yards** - Receiving Yards gained

**Targets** - Pass attempts intended for the receiver

**Target Share** - fraction of team's pass attempts intended for the receiver

**Air Yards** - Sum of target distances intended for receiver

**Air Yard Share** - fraction of team's total Air Yards intended for the receiver

**Dominator** - Share of team's receiving output the player accounted for. Weighted average of (2/3) Yardage Share and (1/3) of Touchdown Share

**Note** - not all stats may match official box score stats exactly. This is largely because we include pass plays with penalties in our calculations. For example, if a player is targeted downfield twice for 60 air yards, but is interfered with on both plays, those will not count as official targets. But those 2 targets and 60 air yards are valuable information that we want to include in our analysis
