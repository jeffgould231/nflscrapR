## Post Draft Power Rankings

As has been already said numerous times, we absolutely killed last weekend. Shout Out Austin for booking the AirBnB.  Shout out to Mark's stomach for keeping it together all weekend. Shout out to Ron for fantastic content. Shout out to Brett and me for running a smooth draft. 



```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(formattable)
rankings_table <-
  read_csv("~/Desktop/nflscrapR/Output/post_draft_rankings.csv")
rankings_table %>%
  mutate(Team = cell_spec(Team, popover = spec_popover(content = rankings_table$Popover,
    title = NULL,                           # title will add a Title Panel on top
    position = "top")),
         FantasyPros = ifelse(
    FantasyPros <= 3,
    cell_spec(FantasyPros, background = "darkgreen", color = "white"),
    ifelse(
      FantasyPros %in% c(4:6),
      cell_spec(FantasyPros, background = "green", color = "white"),
      ifelse(
        FantasyPros %in% c(7:9),
        cell_spec(FantasyPros, background = "orange", color = "white"),
        cell_spec(FantasyPros, background = "red", color = "white")
      )
    )
  ),
  `Week 1 Line Up` = ifelse(str_detect(`Week 1 Line Up`, "A"), cell_spec(`Week 1 Line Up`, color = "darkgreen"),
                            ifelse(str_detect(`Week 1 Line Up`, "C|D"), cell_spec(`Week 1 Line Up`, color = "red"), `Week 1 Line Up`)),
  Playoffs = cell_spec(Playoffs, font_size = 20 * sqrt(Playoffs))) %>%
  select(-Popover) %>%
  kable(escape = F) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hoover", "striped"),
                full = T) %>%
  add_header_above(c(
    " " = 1,
    "Rankings" = 3,
    "Summary" = 1
  ))


```
